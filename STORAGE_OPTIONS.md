# Storage Options - No Backend Required

Your Web3 video platform is **fully decentralized** and doesn't require a traditional database. Here are your storage options:

## 1. Smart Contract Storage (Current Implementation) âœ…

**What's stored on-chain:**
- Video metadata (IPFS hash, title, description)
- Pricing information
- Creator addresses
- View counts and earnings
- Access records (who unlocked what)

**Advantages:**
- Fully decentralized and censorship-resistant
- No backend server needed
- Transparent and verifiable
- No environment variables to manage (except IPFS)

**How it works:**
\`\`\`typescript
// All data is read directly from the blockchain
const { video } = useVideo(videoId)
const { videos } = useVideos(0n, 20n)
const { hasAccess } = useCheckAccess(videoId, userAddress)
\`\`\`

## 2. IPFS for Video Storage

**Current Setup: Pinata (Recommended)**
- Reliable pinning service
- Fast CDN delivery
- Only creators need API keys

**Alternative: Web3.Storage (No API Key Required)**
- Free decentralized storage
- No API keys needed
- Backed by Filecoin

**Alternative: NFT.Storage (Free)**
- Free IPFS pinning
- No credit card required
- Perfect for MVP

## 3. Client-Side Caching (Optional)

Use browser storage to cache video metadata for faster loading:

\`\`\`typescript
// Cache in localStorage
localStorage.setItem(`video_${videoId}`, JSON.stringify(videoData))

// Or use IndexedDB for larger datasets
\`\`\`

## Environment Variables Needed

### For Creators (Upload Videos):
\`\`\`env
# Option 1: Pinata (Current) - Server-side only
PINATA_JWT=your_jwt_token

# Option 2: Web3.Storage (No API key needed - uses wallet signature)
# No env vars required!

# Option 3: NFT.Storage - Server-side only
NFT_STORAGE_TOKEN=your_token
\`\`\`

### For Viewers:
**No environment variables needed!** Viewers just need:
- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
- ETH for gas fees

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Add Pinata JWT in Vercel dashboard (only if you're a creator)
4. Deploy!

**Viewers don't need any setup** - they just connect their wallet.

### Option 2: IPFS Hosting (Fully Decentralized)
Deploy your entire frontend to IPFS:
\`\`\`bash
npm run build
npx ipfs-deploy out/
\`\`\`

Your app is now hosted on IPFS with no centralized server!

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
Free static hosting, no environment variables needed for viewers.

## Security Best Practices

### For Creators:
- **Never commit API keys** to GitHub
- Use Vercel environment variables
- Or use Web3.Storage (no API keys needed)

### For Viewers:
- No API keys needed
- All data is public on blockchain
- Wallet signatures prove ownership

## Recommended Setup for MVP

1. **Use Pinata for uploads** (creators only)
2. **Read all data from smart contract** (no database)
3. **Deploy frontend to Vercel** (free tier)
4. **Viewers need zero setup** (just wallet)

## Future Enhancements

### The Graph Protocol
Index blockchain events for faster queries:
\`\`\`graphql
query {
  videos(first: 20, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    creator
    price
    viewCount
  }
}
