# How to Verify Your Contract on BaseScan

Your contract is deployed at: `0x836171fd02f5f7cafe5ff63f343ad21ddeba7345`

## Step-by-Step Verification

### 1. Open BaseScan
Go to: https://basescan.org/address/0x836171fd02f5f7cafe5ff63f343ad21ddeba7345#code

### 2. Click "Verify and Publish"
Look for the "Verify and Publish" link on the contract page.

### 3. Select Verification Method
- Choose: **"Solidity (Single file)"**

### 4. Enter Compiler Details
- **Compiler Type:** Solidity (Single file)
- **Compiler Version:** v0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6
- **Open Source License Type:** MIT License (MIT)

### 5. Optimization Settings
- **Optimization:** No
- (If you enabled optimization during deployment, select "Yes" and enter 200 runs)

### 6. Copy Contract Code
Open the file: `contracts/CreatorPlatform_ForVerification.sol`

Copy the ENTIRE file contents (all 300+ lines)

### 7. Paste into BaseScan
Paste the code into the "Enter the Solidity Contract Code below" field

### 8. Constructor Arguments
Leave this field **EMPTY** - your contract has no constructor arguments

### 9. Submit
Click "Verify and Publish"

### 10. Wait for Verification
BaseScan will compile and verify your contract (takes 10-30 seconds)

## Success!
Once verified, you'll see:
- Green checkmark on your contract page
- "Contract Source Code Verified" badge
- Readable source code
- Function names in transactions
- Direct contract interaction on BaseScan

## Troubleshooting

### "Bytecode does not match"
- Try compiler version 0.8.19 or 0.8.21
- Check if you enabled optimization during deployment
- Make sure you're using the ForVerification file (no imports)

### "Compilation failed"
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE file
- Check for any copy/paste errors
- Try copying again from the file

### Still having issues?
- Double-check the compiler version you used to deploy
- Verify optimization settings match your deployment
- Contact BaseScan support if needed

## What This Enables

Once verified, users can:
- Read your contract source code
- See all functions and their parameters
- Interact with your contract directly on BaseScan
- Trust that the code matches what's deployed
- Audit the contract for security

Your contract includes:
- Video uploads and purchases
- Subscription tiers
- Tipping system
- Content bundles
