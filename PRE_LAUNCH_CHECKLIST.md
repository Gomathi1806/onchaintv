## Critical Issues to Address Before Launch

### 1. Security - Exposed Pinata JWT
**URGENT**: The Pinata JWT was shared publicly in chat. You MUST:
1. Go to https://app.pinata.cloud/developers/api-keys
2. Delete the exposed key
3. Generate a new JWT
4. Add it to Vercel as `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT`
5. Redeploy the application

### 2. Contract Verification
Verify your contract on BaseScan:
\`\`\`bash
# Visit: https://basescan.org/address/0xce69830d2f14584c368b362d41e9deb9b2e38b8c
# Click "Contract" tab â†’ "Verify and Publish"
# Upload your contract source code and constructor arguments
\`\`\`

### 3. Testing
Run all tests before launch:
\`\`\`bash
npm run test:all
\`\`\`

### 4. Performance Audit
\`\`\`bash
npm run build
# Check bundle size and optimize if needed
\`\`\`
